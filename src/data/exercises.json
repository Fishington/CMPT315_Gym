  "about": "The Dumbbell Lunge is a versatile lower body exercise that targets the quadriceps while also engaging the glutes, hamstrings, and core for stabilization. It is an excellent functional movement that improves balance, coordination, and unilateral strength. With the added resistance of dumbbells, the exercise intensifies muscle activation and helps correct any asymmetries between the legs. Consistent practice leads to improved athletic performance and overall leg development.",

    "Stand upright with a dumbbell in each hand, arms at your sides.",
    "Step forward with one leg into a lunge, lowering your hips until both knees are at approximately 90-degree angles.",
